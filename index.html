            Programming languages are used to program certain things for example apps, games or website.<br>
           It is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers.<br>
             It is a set of instructions written in any specific language ( C, C++, Java, Python) to perform a specific task.

            The different types of programming languages are discussed below:<br>


<div class="para">
<div class="heading">
Procedural Programming Language</div><br>
The procedural programming language is used to execute a sequence of statements which lead to a result.
 Typically, this type of programming language uses multiple variables, heavy loops and other elements,
  which separates them from functional programming languages. Functions of procedural language may control 
  variables, other than function’s value  returns. For example, printing out information.<hr>
<div class="heading"><br>
Functional Programming Language</div><br>
Functional programming language typically uses stored data, frequently avoiding loops in favor of recursive
 functions.The functional programing’s  primary focus is on the return values of functions, and side effects
  and different suggests that storing state are powerfully discouraged. For example, in an exceedingly pure
   useful language, if a function is termed, it’s expected that the function not modify or perform any o/p. 
   It may, however, build algorithmic calls and alter the parameters of these calls. Functional languages are 
   usually easier and build it easier to figure on abstract issues, however, they’ll even be “further from the
    machine” therein their programming model makes it difficult to know precisely, but the code is decoded into
     machine language (which are often problematic for system programming).<br><hr>
<div class="heading">
Object-oriented Programming Language</div><br>
This programming language  views the world as a group of objects that have internal data and 
external accessing parts of that data. The aim this programming language  is to think about the
 fault by separating it into a collection of objects that offer services which can be used to solve
  a specific problem. One of the main principle of object oriented programming language  is encapsulation
   that everything an object will need must be inside of the object. This language also emphasizes reusability 
   through inheritance and the capacity to spread current implementations without having to change a great deal
    of code by using polymorphism.<br><hr>
<div class="heading">
Scripting Programming Language</div><br>
These programming languages are often procedural and may comprise object-oriented language elements, 
but they fall into their own category as they are normally not full-fledged programming languages with 
support for development of large systems. For example, they may not have compile-time type checking.
 Usually, these languages require tiny syntax to get started.<br><hr>
<div class="heading">
Logic Programming Language</div><br>
These types of languages let programmers  make declarative statements and then allow the machine to reason
 about the consequences of those statements. In a sense, this language doesn’t tell the computer how to do 
 something, but employing restrictions on what it must consider doing.<br><hr>

To call these groups ” types  of language ” is really a bit confusing. It’s easy to program
 in an object-oriented style in C language. In truth, most of the languages include ideas and 
 features from various domains, which only helps to increase the  usefulness of these types of 
 languages. Nevertheless, most of the programming languages do not best in all styles of programming.
