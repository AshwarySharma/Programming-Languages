                What is C++

                C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.

                What is C++ used for?

            </div>
            <div class="para">
                To start off, I wouldn’t listen to anyone who says C++ is only or even mostly used in 
                legacy systems. That is flatly wrong. Legacy is a major niche, but far from the biggest
                 or only niche.

First begin by understanding who uses C++. There’s obviously the embedded space an
d performance driven native applications. I won’t touch on these because its they’ve
a been beaten to death by other comments. However, there’s also games and web applications to consider.
